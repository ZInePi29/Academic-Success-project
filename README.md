# Academic-Success-project

This project is to build a classification model, that predicts the academic success of a student. 

It is for a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e6/overview

In this project the first thing I did was getting familiar with the dataset, checking some features. 

I used a RandomForestClassifier, first I tried the default RandomForestClassifier, then I used RandomizedSearchCV to find some better hyperparameters.

After that I started experimenting with the features of the dataset, based on the feature importances.
